usage: ./MolSim [options] inputFileName

options:

	[-d | --deltaT] value
		Sets delta_t to the provided value. It indicates the time between each simulation step.

	[-e | --endTime] value
		Set end_time to the provided value. It indicates the time up to which simulation should take place.
	
	[-h | --help]
		Print this help page.
	
	[-l| --logLevel] value
		Set logLevel to the provided value. Available levels and their functions are:
		0:	debug,           // debug, print all, slowest
    	1:	standard,        // default, no debug
    	2:	noCOut,          // disable std::cout and logging but still write Files, minor performance improvement
    	3:	noFiles,         // don't write output to files but still std::cout and logging, big performance improvement but no data :(
    	4:	onlyCalculations // combination of noCOut and noFiles, no output whatsoever, fastest
	
	[-x]
		Output the data in .xyz format instead of vtk
	
	[-g | --inputGenerator]
		Switch to using the particle generator. inputFileName is either a path to a .json file as an initialization for the simulation or "_" to use the default "collision.json" provided in the input directory. 

	[-t | --inputText]
		Switch to using the older txt file method. inputFileName is either a path to a .txt file as an initialization for the simulation or "_" to use the default "eingabe-sonne.txt" provided in the input directory.
	
	[-o | --outName] value
		Set the prefix to use for the name of all output files. The default is "MD_vtk"

arguments:

	inputFileName
		Path/Filename from which to load the initialization for the simulation.
