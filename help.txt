usage: ./MolSim [options] inputFileName

options:

	[-d | --deltaT] value
		Sets delta_t to the provided value. It indicates the time between each simulation step.

	[-e | --endTime] value
		Set end_time to the provided value. It indicates the time up to which simulation should take place.
	
	[-h | --help]
		Print this help page.
	
	[-l| --logLevel] value
		Set logLevel to the provided value. Available levels and their functions are:
		0: Error        //Used for error logs
		1: Warn         //Used for warning logs, includes error logs
		2: Info         //Used for info logs (default setting), includes warn and error logs
		3: Debug        //Used for debug logs, includes info,warn and error logs
		x: Off          //Any other number turns the logging off
	
	[-x]
		Output the data in .xyz format instead of vtk
	
	[-g | --inputGenerator]
		Switch to using the particle generator. inputFileName is either a path to a .json file as an initialization for the simulation or "_" to use the default "collision.json" provided in the input directory. 

	[-t | --inputText]
		Switch to using the older txt file method. inputFileName is either a path to a .txt file as an initialization for the simulation or "_" to use the default "eingabe-sonne.txt" provided in the input directory.
	
	[-o | --outName] value
		Set the prefix to use for the name of all output files. The default is "MD_vtk"

arguments:

	inputFileName
		Path/Filename from which to load the initialization for the simulation.
